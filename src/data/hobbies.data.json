        "description": "The guitar is a fretted musical instrument that typically has six strings. Why is it another instrument when it's a guitar? Of course, I also have experience playing piano and violin, but my favorite one is guitar. Also, I had a duet and solo concert sponsored by Nava Afarin academy. I am mostly interested in acoustic and electronic guitar. The sound of the guitar gives me immense peace and pleasure. I'm always a fan of acoustic songs and unplugged performances because of the use of different guitars.",
